        <!-- href is the attribute of anchor tag <a> , and we give a URL(Uniform Resource Locater)-->

        <!-- Now, let's see how to specify a external link to the "href" attribute -->
         <a href ="https://w3schools.com">visit the w3schools website </a><br>
         
         <a href="w3schools.com">visit the w3schools, without specifying https(won't work) </a> <!-- atleast it use http to specify external url/link-->
         <br>
         <a href="www.google.com">visit w3schools using www. </a> =>not preffered because it always won't work so use "https" or "http".

<!-- Chatgpt suggestions :

Without https:// — Relative Link Problem
<a href="w3schools.com">visit the w3schools, without specifying https</a>
❌ This does not point to the real website.
The browser treats it as a relative URL, meaning it looks for a file named w3schools.com in your current folder — which usually doesn’t exist.
So, it may lead to a “Page Not Found” (404) error or stay on the same page.

target="_blank" → opens the link in a new tab.

rel="noopener noreferrer" → adds security and privacy when opening new tabs.

<!-- Difference between URL and link -->
<!--
URL(Uniform Resource Locater) : It's an address to an resource(like webpage,image,video etc... in the internet)
Link: it's a clickable element or text that takes u to that address-->
